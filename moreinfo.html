                        The "official history"

                      <hr>
                      <p>
                      Charcoal Ed was first conceived of as an idea in late 1999 by the two members of Charocal Ed as a way to create a soundtrack to video footage that would be shot on location in Death Valley, NV on December 31st 1999 - January 1st 2000. 
                      This video or "film", titled "The End" was/is intended to be a snapshot of a place and time at "the end" of the 2nd millenium AD.
                      Although still not completed, "The End" is footage of the nature and landsape of Death Valley set to an experimental, electronic soundtrack.                   </p>
                    <p>
                      Hence, Charcoal Ed and the first self-titled album - the soundtrack to "The End".  Despite the film not being completed (to date), the music stands 
                      on its own merits as interesting and unique which may appeal to fans of early electronic music. 
                      More specifically, the albums "Atem" and "Alpha Centauri" by Tangerine Dream are obvious influences on the first Charoal Ed album. The music is all recorded "live" in the studio with 
                      little or no overdubs, and using only a couple guitars, keyboards and amps.  The intention was to keep it simple, spontaneous, and freeform.  The result is 9 tracks of instrumental experimentation
                      with very little polish or refinement.
                    </p>
                    <p>After completeing the first album, in early 2000, creation of a follow up began shortly thereafter in the summer of 2000.  This time, the intention was to go in a much more organized and specifically electronic direction. 
                      Featuring extensive use of sequencers to provide "rhythm", the soundscapes were created around the central sequenced sections and layered upon them, in studio overdubs rather than "live".
                    </p>
                    <p>The result is a full hour of electronic soundscapes reminiscent of early Klaus Schulze (albums such as "Timewind" and "Cyborg") and Tangerine Dream (like ("Phaedra" and "Rubycon"). The album achieved some "underground" attention amongst electronic music
                      aficionados, and the members of Charcoal Ed regard it as their favorite of the three albums created. </p>
                    <p>
                      Beginning in May 2001, work began on the third album, "Trinary".  This time around, the focus was on more conventional song structures, form and rhythm.  This means the introduction of drum machines and drum programming that were not present on the first two albums.
                    </p>
                    <p>The tracks are generally shorter and more structured, yet still retain much of the experimental and ambient features of the tfirst two albums. The process of creating the songs and mixing and producing took much longer than the previous efforts,
                      and Trinary was ultimately completed and released in April of 2002.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over the course of less than three years, three albums were created by two people completely independent of any outside influence either monetarily or ideologically, to make music for the fun of it. 
                      Outside of a cover version of the track "Invisible" by The Church, which Charcoal Ed contributed to a tribute album to The Church in 2003, no further music has been forthcoming.  
                      However, perhaps "someday" more music will find its way out of Charcoal Ed.  "The End" is also a project yet to be completed, but may also happen when the time is finally "right".  
                      There are some tracks "from the vaults" that may also be worth further exploration at some point.  Until then, so stands the history of Charcoal Ed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Instrumental? (yes).  Experimental? (basically).  Pretentious? (definitely).</p>
